# Noël's Physics Lab
As you may know I was a physicist! So, I always want to make some experiments. Here it is
the repo where I share data and analysis of these experiments 👨‍🔬

## Experiments
- [Pressure in the TGV](pressure_paris_lyon): Could we deduce the elevation profile of the train
  line with the help of the iPhone barometer?
